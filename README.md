# ðŸ’˜ Loverboy

> I learned my passion in the good old-fashioned school of lover boys

Loverboy makes it easy to add Lua libraries to your [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) project. This exists because I found myself all-too-frequently navigating to the GitHub repo of a library I was interested in, copying the URL to the raw Lua file, `cd`ing to my project, `wget`ing, etc., etc. I wanted a tool to handle that for me. There's [Luarocks](https://luarocks.org/), of course, which is awesome, but can be overkill for my LÃ–VE-specific needs and tends to clutter up my project directory. Hence, Loverboy.
